# Machine Learning Models

Implementations from scratch (if numpy counts as scratch as well as the occaisonal, vastly more efficient, TensorFlow script). They say you really get to know a model when you get more intimate with it, knowing it's pros/cons, when or how best to apply it and so on. That's the main motivation for this repo.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
	
		$ git clone https://github.com/eltonlaw/machine-learning-models.git

2. To satisfy dependencies, run the following:

		$ virtualenv ~/machine-learning
		$ source ~/machine-learning/activate
		$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. And for a quick sanity check:

		$ python3 -m unittest discover 

4. If you're having any trouble, [submit an issue](https://github.com/eltonlaw/machine-learning-models/issues).
