# Machine Learning Models

Implementations in NumPy and TensorFlow.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
	
		$ git clone https://github.com/eltonlaw/machine-learning-models.git

2. To satisfy all the dependencies, run the following:

		$ virtualenv ~/machine-learning
		$ source ~/machine-learning/activate
		$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. If you're having any trouble, [submit an issue](https://github.com/eltonlaw/machine-learning-models/issues).

### Cloud

You totally don't need it for this, but if you're so inclined and don't mind spending a few bucks you can setup a GPU instance if you follow this [guide](https://chatbotslife.com/aws-setup-for-deep-learning-fda04db6df75).
